<section id='abstract'>
  <p>This specification defines the OSLC Architecture Management domain, a RESTful web services interface for the management of architectural resources and relationships between those and related resources such as product change requests, activities, tasks  requirements or test cases. To support these scenarios, this specification defines a set of HTTP-based RESTful interfaces in terms of HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, HTTP response codes, content type handling and resource formats.</p>

<section id='intro' class='informative'>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The general approach taken by the Architecture Management (AM) workgroup 
 follows the OSLC Change Management team's lead by not attempting to re-define 
 model storage formats or even model or other architecture management resource 
 notations, but rather extract out a least common denominator, that could be 
 managed by an AM server, and still be useful to the overall goal of 
 architecture management in a collaborative ALM environment. This does not 
 prevent knowledgeable clients from getting and making use of internal resource 
 content.</p>

  <p>The intent of this specification is to define the capabilities needed to support integration scenarios defined by the Architecture Management working group and not to provide a comprehensive interface to Architecture Management. The resource formats and operations may not match exactly the native artifacts supported by architecture management AM Servers but are intended to be compatible with them. The approach to supporting these scenarios is to delegate operations, as driven by service provider contributed user interfaces, as much as possible and not require a service provider to expose its complete data model and application logic</p> 
  <p>
This specification is a [[!OSLCCore3]] compliant specification, as such most of its content are references to 
[[!OSLCCore3]].

  <section id='terminology'>
    <h3>Terminology</h3>
      <dl class="spaced">
      <dt><dfn>Resource</dfn></dt>
      <dd>An artifact used in the Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) space. A resource is directly addressable 
        with an absolute URL.</dd>

      <dt><dfn>Architecture Management Resource (AMR)</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Directly addressable resources of some domain/notation (i.e. UML, 
        BMPN, ER) that represent an abstraction of some behavior or construct of 
        a system under development. An AMR maintains its identity after 
        refactoring. In the semantic web, an AMR might correspond to a graph 
        that is an instance of some vocabulary or micro-theory.</dd> 
        
        <dt><dfn>Link</dfn></dt>
      <dd>A logical relationship from one resource to another resource. An OSLC AM Link is uni-directional. 
        The subject (source) of a link represents the resource that "knows 
        about" and is referencing another resource (target). The type of 
        relationship is given by a predicate URI (link type). In semantic web 
        terminology, a link would correspond to an RDF statement with a subject 
        (source) a predicate (type) and object (target). The predicate could be 
        defined by property in an RDF schema.</dd>


         <dt><dfn>Link Type (LT)</dfn></dt>
      <dd>A URI that represents the type of a link. In semantic web terminology it is the predicate of an 
        RDF triple. It clarifies the type of relationship between two resources. 
        Link Type URIs may be defined locally, within the OSLC, or externally 
        (i.e. Dublin Core terms). Link types could be defined in RDF 
        Schemas.</dd>


         <dt><dfn>Link type Resource (LTR)</dfn></dt>
      <dd>A resource that contains human consumable information about a Link Type, like its human readable 
        name and description. The resource is managed by the AM provider. The 
        information may be about a Link Type in a different domain (i.e. Dublin 
        Core Terms or OWL). The main use of a LTR is for clients who want to 
        build a UI for users that clearly labels potential link types.</dd>


    <dt>AM Client</dt>
    <dd>An implementation of the OSLC Architecture Management specifications as a client. OSLC AM Clients consume services provided by AM servers.</dd>

    <dt>AM Server</dt>
    <dd>A server implementing the OSLC Architecture Management domain specifications. OSLC AM clients consume services provided by AM Servers. The use of the terms Client and Server are intended to distinguish typical consumers and providers of OSLC resources in a distributed environment based on REST. A particular application component could be a client for some OSLC domain services and a server for the same or another domain.</dd>

<h2>AM Service Provider Capabilities</h2>

<section id="resourceShapes1">
<h3>Resource Shapes</h3>

  <p>OSLC AM services providers <strong>SHOULD</strong> support <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Resource_Shapes">Resource Shapes</a> as defined in <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Resource_Shapes">OSLC Core Specification</a></p>

</section>

<section id="resources">
<h3>Service Provider Resources</h3>

  <p>OSLC AM Servers <strong>MUST</strong> provide a <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Service_Provider_Resources">Service Provider Resource</a> that can be retrieved at a implementation dependent URI.</p>

<p>OSLC AM Servers <strong>MUST</strong> provide a <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Service_Provider_Catalog_Resources">Service Provider Catalog Resource</a> that can be retrieved at a implementation dependent URI.</p>

<p>OSLC AM Servers <strong>MUST</strong> provide a <code>oslc:serviceProvider</code> property for their defined resources that will be the URI to a <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Service_Provider_Resources">Service Provider Resource</a>. This does not prevent AM Servers from providing multiple servie provider properties with different values, if the service provider supports multiple OSLC domain specifications, and the resource is applicable to multiple domains.</p>

<p>OSLC AM Servers <strong>MUST</strong> supply a value of <code>http://open-services.net/ns/am#</code> for the property <code>oslc:domain</code> on either <code>oslc:ServiceProvider</code> or <code>oslc:ServiceProviderCatalog</code> resources.</p>

</section>


<section id="creationfactories">
<h3>Creation Factories</h3>

<p>OSLC AM Servers <strong>MAY</strong> support <a 
 href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Creation_Factories">Creation Factories</a> as defined by OSLC Core.</p>

<p>OSLC AM Servers <strong>MAY</strong> discard properties it does not recognize and continue the POST operation without warning to the client. The returned resource will contain the accepted properties (and server generated properties like the dcterms:identifer) so clients will be able to confirm if required what was accepted.</p>

<p>If OSLC AM Servers support the creation of resources from the OSLC defined <code>oslc_am:Resource</code> format, there <strong>MUST</strong> be at least one <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Creation_Factories">Creation Factory</a> entry in the Services definition, and its <code>oslc:usage</code> property MUST be set to <code>http://open-services/ns/core#default</code>. The <code>oslc:resourceType</code> MUST be set to <code>http://open-services.net/ns/am#Resource</code>.</p>

<p>If OSLC AM Servers support the creation of resources from a resource other than <code>oslc_am:Resource</code>, there <strong>MUST</strong> be a separate creation services definition whose <code>oslc:usage</code> property <strong>MUST NOT</strong> be set to <code>http://open-services/ns/core#default</code>.</p>

</section>

<section id="querycapabilities">
<h3 id="querycapabilities">Query Capabilities</h3>

<p>OSLC AM Servers <strong>SHOULD</strong> support the <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Query_Capabilities">Query Capabilities</a> as defined by OSLC Core for both <a href="#Resource_Architecture_Management">oslc_am:Resource </a> and <a href="#Resource_Link_Type_Resource_LTR">oslc_am:LinkType </a> resources.</p>

<p>If the service provider supports query capability for <a href="#Resource_Architecture_Management">oslc_am:Resource </a> resources, it <strong>MUST</strong> support the following query parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>oslc.where</code></li>
<li><code>oslc.searchTerms</code></li>
</ul>

<p>OSLC AM Servers <strong>SHOULD</strong> support query capability for <a href="#Resource_Link_Type_Resource_LTR">oslc_am:LinkType </a> resources. If supported then AM Servers <strong>MUST</strong> support a simple GET without any simple query parameters that returns all link type resources. AM Servers <strong>SHOULD</strong> support the full simple query syntax.</p>
</section>

<section id="delegatedUIs">
<h3>Delegated UIs</h3>

<p>OSLC AM Servers <strong>SHOULD</strong> support the selection of resources by delegated web-based user interface dialogs <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Delegated_User_Interface_Dialogs">Delegated UIs</a> as defined by OSLC Core.</p>

<p>OSLC AM Servers <strong>MAY</strong> support the creation of resources by delegated web-based user interface dialogs <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Delegated_User_Interface_Dialogs">Delegated UIs</a> as defined by OSLC Core.</p>

<p>In <code>oslc:Dialog</code> elements, the two optional child elements; <code>oslc:hintWidth</code> and <code>oslc:hintHeight</code> specify the suggested size of the dialog or frame to render the HTML content in. Expected for the size values are defined by <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS1/#length-units">CSS length units</a>.</p>
